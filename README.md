## Description:
The housing market is subject to the same economic laws of supply and demand as every other industry. When there are more buyers than sellers, the supply of houses goes down and the demand goes up, making houses harder to buy and more expensive.

The typical home value of homes in the United States is $293,349. This value is seasonally adjusted and only includes the middle price tier of homes. United States home values have gone up 15.0% over the past year and Zillow predicts they will rise 13.2% in the next year.

## Questions:
* How have the household prices reacted over the past decade?

* Which cities in those states have the highest household prices?

* Are there obvious factors/correlation?

## Analysis:
1. Clean and modify data using Jupyter Notebook/Pandas

2. Use PostgreSQL as database

3. Flask/Python

4. HTML, CSS, and Javascript

5. D3, Plotly, Chart.js and Leaflet to visualize
